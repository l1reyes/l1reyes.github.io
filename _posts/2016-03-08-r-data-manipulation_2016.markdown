description: A workshop aiming to teach data manipulation in R with Genomics data.

## Introduction

This workshop is geared to researchers wanting to use R for basic data manipulation and analysis. It will introduce participants to the basics of data tidying and manipulation (notably using tidyr & dplyr), how to set up data processing pipelines, and briefly cover working with a database. We will be using a genomics dataset for this course.  This workshop is designed for novices, but we would like you to have some experience with R or have attended the Intro to R course on 3/7.

## Topics:

* Data Manipulation Using dplyr (subsetting, filtering, aggregating)
* Dataframe Manipulation with tidyr (reshaping data)

## Date
March 8, 2016 (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

## Location

Biomedical Library Building - Classroom 4

## Audience

All graduate students or researchers.
